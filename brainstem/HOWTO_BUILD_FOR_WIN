We use the MXE cross-compile environment to build a version of brainstem that
will run on windows.

(1) Get MXE
Decide where to put it.  /opt is a good choice.
You need write permission in /opt. Type this:

cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git

[added]
to update to current versions, clone won't work. use this:

git pull origin master

(2) Build MXE and packages we need for brainstem
To build for creating 64-bit executables, type this:

cd /opt/mxe 
make MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static qtbase
make MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static glm

If you make qt instead of qtbase, quite a lot more gets built.
You can pick what subsets to build if you want.

(4) Set up path to mxe executables
Add this to your .bashrc file, or the .rc file for your shell of choice.
export PATH=/opt/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH

(5) Create the Makefile
cd to where your Qt sources and .pro file is. For the brainstem sources, run
this:

x86_64-w64-mingw32.static-qmake-qt5 brainstem.pro -r -spec win32-g++
This will create Makefile_win.qt.

(6) Build brainstem.exe, like so:

make -f Makefile_win.qt
or
make brainstem.exe
